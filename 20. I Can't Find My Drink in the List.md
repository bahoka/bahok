I Can't Find My Drink in the List
In this article, we'll cover a pretty common situation: you've just had a drink you want to log in Simple, but can't find a proper match for it in the app's catalog. How big of a deal is it, and how do we fix it?

## 1. Why This Might Happen

**We're the New Guy**.
Simple is a fairly new app – and while it's mostly a good thing, we do admit to not having every drink out there in the books. But it's an easily solvable problem, and we're adding tons of new drinks to our catalog with every update.

**Can't Catch 'Em All**.
A great part of what makes life exciting is the number of new drinks randomly popping in grocery stores every week.

So even if and when we add all drinks known to mankind to the app's catalog, a dozen of new drinks will appear without giving us a proper heads up. That is to say, a situation when you won't be able to find an exact match for the drink you had in Simple is inevitable. But it's not a bad thing, and it won't affect the accuracy of your data.

## 2. What We Recommend

If you can't find a perfect match for your drink in the app's catalog, simply look for something similar and log it instead. Don't worry – this will not hurt the accuracy of your data.

**Example**: *if you can't find your 'Minute Maid’ orange juice in the list, you could log the 'Simply Orange' juice instead. While not identical, they're a pretty close match in terms of nutritional and hydration value, so this is a totally viable method.*

## 3. Suggest a Drink
