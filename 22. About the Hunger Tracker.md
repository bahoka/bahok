In this short tutorial, we'll cover the basics of the in-app Hunger Tracker: from what it is to what makes it so important for your wellbeing.

## 1. What is this Hunger Tracker?

Essentially, the Hunger Tracker is a tool that allows you to understand, cope and power through the hunger pangs that you'll inevitably experience during your first weeks of fasting.

While some extent of hunger is inevitable during a fast, suffering is totally optional. And Simple will make sure your first steps on the road to mastering Intermittent Fasting are painless.

**TIP**: *Hunger is Less Than You Think. Scientifically speaking, the real hunger (an actual, physiological need for food) will not set on before you go 48 hours straight with absolutely nothing to eat.*

Thus, the sensation you'll be dealing with during a fast is just your body telling you that you're breaking an old habit of eating something every couple of hours. That's what the sensation is â€“ your old habits dying hard.

## 2. How the Hunger Tracker Helps

Here are just some things that the Hunger Tracker was designed to help you with:

*1. **Telling real hunger from emotional hunger**. Intentional or not, logging your hunger pangs gives you a moment to rationalize your sensations and get a better idea of whether the hunger is real or just emotional. And that's a crucial part of mindful eating;*

*2. **Stress relief**. Sharing your thoughts and feelings with your virtual assistant can feel strangely therapeutic. Try it!*

*3. **Signs of progress**. The change in time of hunger onset is a big criterion of your fasting progress. This information will help Simple provide you with even more valuable insights and accurate recommendations;*

*4. **Increased awareness**. Tracking hunger makes you notice and reflect, turning hazy emotions into understandable sensations that you can control. This will not only put you in control of your emotions but also give you a palpable sense of progress. At some point, you'll even catch yourself thinking that you don't mind the hunger pangs at all anymore!*
