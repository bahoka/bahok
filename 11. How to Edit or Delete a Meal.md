**How Editing a Meal Can Affect Your Fasts:**

**PLEASE NOTE**: *if you edit a meal that starts or ends a fast, this will affect the corresponding fast as well.*

* **If you delete a meal that starts a fast**, this will automatically delete the fast it started;
* **If you delete a meal that ends a fast**, this will automatically prolong the fasting period until the next meal in your log. If there is no such meal logged in Simple, the app will change your current status back to 'Fasting'.
