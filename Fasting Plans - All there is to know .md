In this article, we'll try and do our best to cover everything there is to know about Fasting Plans in simple – from what they are, how they work and how to switch from your current plan to a different one.
## 1. What is a Fasting Plan?
In Simple, a Fasting Plan is a complex methodology that consists of three main aspects:

<p align="center">1. A fasting protocol: a combination of time periods when you either fast (fasting period) or eat (eating window); <br/>

<p align="center">2. Body hydration goals (may vary depending on your active Fasting Protocol);<br/>

</p>

<p align="center">3. Physical activity (in Simple, physical activity is measured by tracking your daily amount of steps).<br/>

## 2. Fasting Protocols Explained

In Simple, Fasting Protocols are split into two categories:

1.Intra-day protocols. These protocols are named after the number of hours (within the limits of one day) allocated for a fasting period and an 'eating window' respectively.

<p align="center"> For instance: the 16:8 intra-day protocol means that:
  <br/>

</p>

 * your eating window for the day will last 6 hours;
 * your fasting period for the day will last 8 hours.

2.Daily protocols. These protocols may vary in name depending on which days you choose to reserver for eating and which – for fasting.

## 3. Choosing a Fasting Protocol
Your choice of a Fasting Protocol defines how your fasting tracker will work. Every time you start or end a fast, the tracker will re-evaluate all data to offer you personalized guidance on when to eat or fast next.

The complex algorithm behind Simple's guidance system is based on your currently selected Fasting Protocol.

The Simple app allows you to choose between two types of protocols:
### 3.1 Flexible Protocols
There is a collection of flexible protocols available for you in Simple.

Flexible protocols are NOT bound by any certain schedule: every time you start or end a fast, the tracker begins its countdown until your next fast or eating window in full accordance with the selected protocol. Even if this means your next meal will be due at 2 am.

Flexible protocols do not have a rigid schedule and are controlled solely by the time at which you start and end your fasts.

Tip: Flexible Protocols are a perfect match for users who would like the app to adjust to common irregularities in their everyday life's schedule.
### 3.2 Scheduled Protocols
As the name suggests, scheduled protocols are bound by a custom schedule that you can adjust to your lifestyle, dietary habits and personal preferences.

Scheduled protocols will allow you to start your fasts ahead or behind schedule, but will try to get you back on track the next day by shrinking or expanding your next 'eating window'.

## 4. How to Switch to a Different Fasting Plan
With Simple, you can always change your fasting plan, protocol or schedule to a new one. Here's how you do it:


<p align="center"> 1.Tap the 'Personal Program' option at the top of your fasting tracker's main screen: <br/>

</p>

## 5. Joker Days

Some Fasting Plans in Simple will allow you to use Joker Days.

Joker Days are the days when Simple allows you to get a break from your current fasting plan with no negative impact on your overall progress. Technically, every Joker Day is a day that offers an expanded 'eating window'.

</p>

*Use Case: we recommend setting up Joker Days if you know there will be days in your life when for some reason (e.g. a family dinner) you know you won't be able to stick to your fasting plan.*

And that's all there is to know about Fasting Plans, Protocols and Schedules. At least for now, that is! If you would like to learn more about Fasting Protocols, try browsing the 'Insights' section of the app or contact our [customer support service](mailto:care@simple.life)
