This article will show you how to introduce the following changes to a fast you previously logged in Simple:

- edit your personal comment on the fast;
- edit the mood you chose to associate with how you felt when that fast ended;
- permanently delete the selected fast.

If you would like to edit the time at which a specific fast started or ended, please consult the ['How to Edit or Delete a Meal'](LINLK) article instead, like every fast in Simple starts and ends with logging a meal.

## How to Edit the Mood and/or Comment You Left for a Fast

<p align="center"> 1. Please begin by accessing the Journal section of the app. Essentially, this section is your wellbeing log, and as such it contains absolutely every activity you're tracking with Simple – including all previously logged fasts;<br/>

**PLEASE NOTE**: *Deleting a fast is permanent! Simple will not be able to restore a fast that you delete from your Journal. We kindly ask you to be extra careful with this option.*

<p align="center">4. If you choose to edit the fast, simply introduce then save all changes you would like to make.<br/>

And that's it, simple as that! Your edits will be applied immediately.
