This article offers a brief explanation of how the Simple app tracks and logs your daily amount of steps and how it's integrated with the Apple Health service.

## 1. How Does Simple Track Steps?

1.**Apple Health** *(Recommended)*. By default, Simple automatically tracks the number of steps you make daily by collecting this information from Apple Health. This is the most secure and efficient way of data sharing between apps, designed and recommended by the Apple company.

2.**Fitbit.** Alternatively, if you're using the popular FitBit app to track steps, Simple can get this information from FitBit directly.

## 2. What if My Step Tracking App Doesn't Work with Apple Health?

Unless that app is called 'FitBit', we highly recommend switching to any other step-tracking app that utilizes Apple Health. Simple will not be able to track your steps otherwise.

## 3. How to Manually Input my Number of Steps?

**We kindly advise against this method,** since tracking steps manually has proven to be a highly inaccurate method. 

Nonetheless, you can always adjust your number of steps in Apple Health directly. All changes made in Apple Health will be automatically transferred to Simple.
