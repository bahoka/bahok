This article explains why logging some drinks while fasting can interrupt the fast.

## 1. Some Drinks are Just Liquid Meals
A common misconception among fasting practitioners is that food doesn't really count as food if it comes in liquid form. Nonetheless, a lot of soft drinks (like juice or soda) can contain a substantial amount of calories and/or sugar in them.

And even if you don't treat a can of soda as a meal, your body's digestion system most certainly does. That's why it's only accurate that Simple automatically interrupts your current fast if you have a drink rich in sugar and/or calories â€“ after all, every fast start and ends with a meal, right? And, as we said, your body will treat some drinks like a proper meal.

## 2. How to Tell Fast-Breaking Drinks in Simple?
Whenever you log a drink with Simple, every drink that can interrupt a fast will be tagged with *"This drink will break your fast!"* <img width="90" src="https://dkea7qxfae4ft.cloudfront.net/kb/breakf.png">, so you can easily tell them from *'safe drinks'*.

## 3. What Should I Drink During a Fast?
During a fast, we highly recommend that you limit your choice of drinks to the following list:

* pure water (or lemon water);
* coffee with no milk and no sugar;
* tea with no milk and no sugar (herbal and ginger tea are also cool).

## 4. On Sugar-Free Sweeteners

*Diet Soda*. While diet soda does not technically contain any sugar and thus will not interrupt your fast, we kindly ask you to avoid having it during a fast. Even without sugar, a sweet drink can trick your body into starting digestive processes for no good reason.

*Sugar Substitutes*. The same could be said for any natural sweetener or sugar substitute product: please avoid those during a fast.
