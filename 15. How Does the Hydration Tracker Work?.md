To be perfectly accurate, the Drink Tracker in our app does not just track the sole amount of liquid you consume but also takes the so-called 'absorption coefficient' into account.

**Tip: Absorption Coefficient**. *Not all drinks are equal in terms of their hydration value. In other words, an **8 oz can of Coke not contribute exactly 8 oz of water to your body**, and some drinks (like any liquor) will even drain your body of water.*

To make a proper assessment of your body's water balance, Simple takes all the aforementioned facts into account. And while the app can't always be 100% accurate on the subject without constantly asking you for blood samples (it won't!), having a pretty accurate estimation of your hydration level is better than not having any data at all. We hope we'll agree on this one.

This is why we highly encourage you to **track everything you drink with Simple to get some valuable insights on how well you've been hydrating your body.**
