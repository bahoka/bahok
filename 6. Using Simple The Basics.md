Using Simple: The Basics
In this short tutorial, you'll learn how to read, interpret and even adjust the app's main screen. We will also try and explain why tracking is a critical part of your success with Simple, and how you can make the most out of this feature.

## 1. Main Screen Overview
### 1.1 Time Tracker
Introducing first – the timer! It may seem intimidating at first, but, with time, we hope you'll learn to love and appreciate it! After all, you'll be seeing each other pretty often.

Depending on whether or not you're currently fasting, the time tracker will either:

* show the duration of your current fast (for when you're fasting)
* show the duration of your current 'eating window' (for when you're having a meal).

***Tip*: What Makes the Timer Tick**. The timer's settings (including suggested time periods and tips) depend on your selected Fasting Plan. To learn more about fasting plans and how to switch between them, please consult [this article in our Knowledge Base](LINK).

### 1.2 Heads-up Tips
The text section below the timer will supply you with tips on what's up and what's next.

Depending on your current activity, this section will either show you:

* how much time is left before your next fast (during your 'eating window')
* how long it is until your next meal (during a fast).

### 1.4 Changing the Timer's Appearance
Looks are important, so if you're not happy with the timer's default appearance, you can always swap it for something more fashionable. Here's how you do it:

*NOTE*: Changing the timer's appearance will not alter its functionality. This is just a cosmetic tweak.

## 2. Tracking and Logging
We can't stress this enough – **tracking every meal, drink and fast you have in the app is paramount to your success with Simple.**

### 2.1 Why is Tracking So Important?
Simple is not based on a rigid pre-defined schedule. Instead, our app is all about delivering a custom experience and making a perfect fit for your goals, lifestyle, and physique. To achieve this, Simple relies heavily on you logging your meals, fast and physical activities within the app.

Please note that for the app to work as designed, we kindly ask you to manually log the beginning and the end of every fast within the app.

### 2.2 What's the Bare Minimum for the App to Work?
As stated before, the bare minimum of user input required for Simple to work properly is:

1. Manually logging the start of every fast in the app;
2. Manually logging the end of every fast in the app.

But for optimal user experience, we highly encourage you to **go the extra mile and track every meal and drink** you have in the app just as well.

### 2.3 What are the Benefits of Tracking More?
Logging every food and drink you have during the day is the way to go to get the most out of your Simple experience for two main reasons:

1. It allows Simple to supply you with **more personalized tips, suggestions, and valuable insights**;
2. It helps you get a clear picture of your dietary habits and better understand your eating patterns. This knowledge alone has a proven **positive impact on the wellbeing of over 75% of our users**.

And that's it for the basics!
