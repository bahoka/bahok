## 1. The Core Idea Behind the App
Unlike dozens of its predecessors, The Simple app was designed with just one simple purpose in mind: break the borders of a mere fasting tracker to become a **smart, reliable and resourceful wellbeing assistant** in your everyday life. 

And seeing as nutrition is a fundamental part of that life (and that wellbeing!), Simple is there to help you **build and sustain healthy eating habits** with a focus on enhancing your quality of life, and NOT turning it into a dietary self-torture.

## 2. PAL: How Simple Works
From a user's perspective, the Simple app workflow is built around **three key principles:**

- **Plan.** Every great thing starts with a great plan. Simple helps you build a solid, efficient and easy-to-follow dietary plan based on your goals, lifestyle and personal preferences.

- **Achieve.** A plan is only as good as its execution. That's why Simple offers a flexible and non-intrusive system to help you achieve your short- and long-term goals, overcome any obstacles and quickly get back on track if something doesn't go as planned. 

- **Learn.** Simple is supplied with tons of unique learning materials that will help you master intermittent fasting and gain a deeper understanding of your body, nutrition, and the positive impact your new habits will have on your overall wellbeing.
