No worries! Such things happen to all of us, and it's nothing that Simple can't fix. Just follow this quick tutorial and we'll make things right in a matter of minutes:

- You Can Log Meals Retroactively.

Simple allows you to log any meal that you've had for the past 3 days. So, say, if you had a meal Sunday, but forgot to log it in the app, you can still do it on Monday. Or Tuesday or Wednesday. But, sadly, Thursday is where we'll have to draw the line.

So if it's been less than 3 days, you can just log a meal as you normally would, but mention you had in within the past 3 days. If you'd like more instructions on how to log a meal with Simple, please see this article in our Knowledge Base.
  
- The Same Thing Works with Fasts

In Simple, every fast starts and ends with logging a meal. So if you forgot to log the start of your fast in good time – just tap the ‘Start Fasting’ button and, when selecting the fast-starting meal, select the time and day when you actually had that meal.
  
**Please remember that the '3 days' rule applies here just as well.**
  
- If You Logged a Meal but Forgot to Start Your Fast

This is not a problem either. Just tap 'Start Fasting'  <img width="40" src="https://dkea7qxfae4ft.cloudfront.net/kb/start3.png"> and, when prompted, select that previously logged meal as your *'fast-starting meal'*.
