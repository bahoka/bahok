## 1. Simple is NOT a Calorie Tracker
The Simple app is not – in any capacity – a calorie tracker, nor will it ever be one. Our firm decision against this idea is based on multiple scientific observations and experiments that suggest the following:

* For all its complexity, calorie tracking remains a highly inaccurate method that fails to deliver a consistent, lasting result to its practitioners;
* Not all calories are equal in terms of nutritional value and their impact on your health and wellbeing. Three green apples offer roughly the same amount of calories as a can of coke, but it doesn't take a medical degree to tell which is better for your health;
* [A recent scientific study](https://www.1843magazine.com/features/death-of-the-calorie) reports that calorie tracking can provoke eating disorders of various severity;

## 2. Simple Does NOT Offer Meal Plans
Our own research and experience show that forcing a strict diet or a rigid meal plan on a person does not provide a lasting positive result:

* Strict food limitations always lead to intense cravings;
* Cravings always end up with a relapse;
* Hence, if you follow a strict diet, you risk getting into an endless loop of fighting your cravings only to cave into them inevitably.

As you can tell, not only does this method cause a significant amount of stress, but it also denies you any consistent results in your diet.

## 3. Simple is NOT a Shortcut to Weight Loss
No *'10 steps to ripped abs'* or *'lean body in 2 weeks'* solutions to find here. If you're looking for the quickest route possible to losing weight in record time, you might want to give this app a hard pass. You might, but it doesn't mean you should.

Unlike some apps and 'techniques' that promise you quick results with zero effort, here at Simple we know that the path to a better, healthier life is not a sprint, but a marathon. 

It doesn't mean it's hard and takes a lifetime though! The Simple way is a natural, effective and easy-to-adapt technique that helps you achieve so much more than weight loss. It lets you build a foundation for a new, healthier and happier lifestyle that will make your results last for decades, not weeks.
