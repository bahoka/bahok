In this article, we'll show you **how to reset your Simple experience** and restart your journey as nothing happened. The entire procedure is as simple as two steps:  
# 1. Reset Your Simple Account
In order to reset your Simple experience:

</p>  

<span style="color:red">***PLEASE NOTE!*** </span>
This action is irreversible. Resetting your Simple account will permanently delete all previously stored user data from the app. Deleted user data can not be restored.

# 2. Restore Your Subscription
<span style="color:red">***IMPORTANT!***</span>
Resetting your Simple account does NOT cancel your active Simple subscription. It does, however, reset your subscription details and redirect you to the Payment Screen. Please do NOT purchase a new subscription when you get there!  
Instead, please use the **'Restore'** button to restore all your previous purchases without any extra payment.
