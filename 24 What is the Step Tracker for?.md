Everyone knows what a **step tracker** is – it's an app that tracks the number of steps you make every day. But if you're reading this, then you're probably be stuck wondering what a step tracker has to do with a Fasting App. Well, allow us to clear this up:

**Physical activity (and movement in particular) is a vital part of your wellbeing.** And for people who would like to see some positive weight changes in their body, it's an important part of the fasting technique as well.

That's why Simple cares a great deal for how much you move, making it an important part of our intermittent fasting methodology. In fact, **moving as much as you can is so important for fasting that we made it a part of our fasting plan goals.**

With all that in mind, we highly encourage you to **stay active and move as much as you can.** After all, there's so much stuff to see and so many places to visit in life – and taking a walk instead of driving really lets you enjoy the scenery.
