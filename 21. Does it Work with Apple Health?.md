Yes! With Simple, you can securely import and export your wellbeing data to and from other apps via the Apple Health service. Please see the most common use cases for that:

* **Other water trackers.** If you're using a third-party water tracker and would like to import data from it to Simple – it's totally possible. 

* **Other wellbeing-apps.** If you're using other well-being apps (such as they are) and would like to import their data to Simple, then sure – that's cool too!

Should you have any questions, comments or suggestions regarding the app's integration and/or data sharing with Apple Health, please do not hesitate to contact our customer support service at [customer support service](mailto:care@simple.life).
