As you might know, the Simple app is not just a fasting tracker, but a fully functional wellbeing-app. And naturally, **keeping the body water balance in check is a vital part of every person's wellbeing.**

Vital as it is, the subject of proper hydration is often dismissed by the majority of people and fasting apps alike. But not Simple. We're here to make sure you notice the importance of proper hydration in your everyday life, get valuable insights on your body water balance and help you stay hydrated 24/7.

Vernacularly, you're 60% water. And the Drink Tracker is here to keep it that way.

# 1. The Problem of Day-to-Day Hydration
A lot of people stay an under-hydrated day in day out due to lack of awareness for one simple fact:

***Not drinks are the same in terms of hydration value. Various drinks you have throughout the day (juice, soda, coffee, etc.) let your body absorb different amounts of water.***

This may sound weird, but some drinks will drain your body of water instead of adding to its water balance. Any liquor makes for a vivid example of this scientific fact: the nastiest part of every hangover has severe dehydration to thank for.

In other words, the problem of staying hydrated is not as obvious as popular culture would have us believe – the *'just drink something when you're thirsty'* rule can get you nowhere fast.

# 2. The Role of Hydration in Fasting
When you adopt Intermittent Fasting into your lifestyle, staying properly hydrated becomes an even more important matter. Can you guess why?

You're absolutely right if you think that is because **during a fast you may turn down certain meals that usually had a drink in it** – like a can of Coke or a glass of juice to wash it down. This may not sound like much of a loss, but in the big picture – your body will miss out on a lot of water unless you adjust properly.

And that's exactly why **drinking the right amount of water every day is a vital part of a healthy and safe fasting lifestyle**, making it a vital part of the Simple app as well!

Simple take a lot of unnecessary worries and calculations related to hydration off your shoulders. **Just use the in-app tracker to stay on track with your daily hydration goal, and life will never taste dry!**
