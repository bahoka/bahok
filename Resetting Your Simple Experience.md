In this article, we'll show you how to reset your Simple experience and restart your journey as nothing happened. The entire procedure is as simple as two steps:  
# 1. Reset Your Simple Account
In order to reset your Simple experience:

- First, access the 'Profile' screen in the app:

This action is irreversible. Resetting your Simple account will permanently delete all previously stored user data from the app. Deleted user data can not be restored.
# 2. Restore Your Subscription
<span style="color:red">*IMPORTANT!*</span>
Resetting your Simple account does NOT cancel your active Simple subscription. It does, however, reset your subscription details and redirect you to the Payment Screen. Please do NOT purchase a new subscription when you get there!  
Instead, please use the 'Restore' button to restore all your previous purchases without any extra payment.

And that does it for the Account Reset procedure. Hereâ€™s to a great new start!
