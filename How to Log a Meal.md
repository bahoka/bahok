As evident from the name, this quick tutorial will show you how to log your very first meal with Simple:

<p align="center">1. First, look for the big '+' button on the main screen of the app. It looks kinda like this:
<br/>

</p>

<p align="center">2. Next, tap the 'Log a Meal' icon at the top of your screen:

</p>

</p>
<p align="center">3. Then, select your meal type â€“ was it a drink, a proper meal or just a quick snack? You also have to choose when you had it:

*Tip: This feature allows you to retroactive log any meal that you had for the past three days (but not more) and forgot to add in a good time.*

</p>

<p align="center"> 4. Finally, at this point, you can either <br/>
<br/>
- Log the meal with no extra details by tapping the 'Log without details' button (Not recommended);<br/>
- Tap the 'Next' button to add extra details to the meal you're tracking. We highly encourage you to go with this option, as it will allow you to receive valuable insights on your health, wellbeing and eating patterns in the future.<br/>

When adding all the details about your meal, try not to puzzle your head too much with questions like 'Was this meal healthy?' etc. Instead, just use your gut feeling (see what we did there?) and let your personal feelings and emotions dictate the answers. This is absolutely okay.

And that's how you log a meal with Simple! 

*Oh, one last tip: logging a meal during a fasting period will automatically end your active fast. This is because of Simple tracks every fast as a substantial time period between two meals.*
