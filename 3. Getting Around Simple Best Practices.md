In this article, we'll bring you up to speed on how the Simple app works and show you how to start tracking your meals, learn and practice fasting techniques and get valuable insights on your overall wellbeing.

## The Basics
As the name suggests, the Simple app was designed to be... well, simple to use and understand. But just to be safe, allow us to explain the basics first:

### Manual Tracking
Simple is not a strict schedule-based app, it's a tracker. And as such, the app relies on your input to know when you need to know when you're actually fasting. That's why **manually logging your meals, drinks and fasts is a core mechanics of Simple.**

### Logging Meals, Drinks and Fasts
Worry not – tracking your meals, drinks and fasting periods in Simple takes little time and even less effort. Whenever you eat, drink, begin or end your fast, simply log it in the app by tapping the big '**+**' button, as shown in the example below:

## Tip 1: Tracking Your Meals and Drinks
The most important part of using Simple is keeping a detailed and honest track of everything you eat and drink. So please make sure you **always log everything you eat and drink in the app**.

**Q**: *I forgot to log my meal in a good time. What do I do?*

**A**: No worries! With Simple, you can retroactively log any meal or drink you had (but forgot to mention) within the limits of the past three days.

## Tip 2: Starting a Fast
When the time is right (based on your personal program) the app will offer you to begin fasting. Here are the two easy things to remember here:

1. Keep an eye out for the app to alert you on the time your next fast begins;
2. When you're ready to begin your fast, make sure you log it in the app by tapping the **'Start fasting'** button. <img width="40" src="https://dkea7qxfae4ft.cloudfront.net/kb/start3.png">

## Tip 3: Ending a Fast
Ending a fast should feel even easier than starting it. And it is:

1. Look for a specific alert: the app will notify you when the time is right to end your fast;
2. Don't forget to log the end of your fast in the app using the **'End this fast' button**. <img width="40" src="https://dkea7qxfae4ft.cloudfront.net/kb/end.jpeg"> <br/>

**Q**: *I forgot to log my meal in a good time. What do I do?*

**A**: Worry not! Even if you forget to log the end of your fast in good time, you can do it retroactively – the same way you normally would.
