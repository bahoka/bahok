## How Editing a Drink Can Affect Your Fasts

**In Simple, some drinks (tagged with *"This drink will break your fast!"* <img width="90" src="https://dkea7qxfae4ft.cloudfront.net/kb/breakf.png">) can start or end a fast**, as they are technically considered as liquid meals. If you edit a *"This drink will break your fast!"* <img width="90" src="https://dkea7qxfae4ft.cloudfront.net/kb/breakf.png"> - tagged drink that starts or ends a fast, this will affect the corresponding fast as well:

* If you delete a drink that starts a fast, this will automatically delete the fast it started;
* If you delete a drink that ends a fast, this will automatically prolong the fasting period until the next meal or drink in your log.
* If there is no such meal or drink logged in Simple, the app will change your current status back to 'Fasting'.
