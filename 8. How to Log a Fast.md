In this tutorial, we'll teach you how to log your debut fast with Simple!

Every time you start or end a fast, please be sure to let Simple know by logging these events in the app. This will ensure that all of Simple's awesome guidance technologies and push-notifications are working properly, as well as help your virtual assistant keep track of your progress and offer you timely advice and support should you need it.

Now, let us get our first fast in the books. Here's how you do it:
## 1. Logging a Fast: the Step-by-Step Guide
### 1.1 How to Start a Fast with Simple

<p align="center">1. To log the beginning of your fast with Simple, first find and tap the '+' button on the app's main screen:

</p>

<p align="center">3. In simple, every fast begins and ends with a meal. So at this point, the app will offer you to proceed with either of the two options:
<br/>

</p>

  * Start counting your fasting period from the latest meal you logged. This is extremely convenient for when, say, you've already had and logged your lunch and then decided to skip dinner. This way you can tell the app your current fast started right after lunch. Nice, isn't it?
  
  * Alternatively, you can start your fast with a new, previously unlogged meal. This way, Simple will prompt you to first log your latest meal as you normally would, before starting the fast.

This option also allows you to pick the time you had that meal. So if you forgot to log a meal or a fast in good time, you can always do it retroactively using this option.

## 1.2 How to End a Fast with Simple
For when your watch has ended, and it's time to eat again, here's how you log this joyful moment in Simple:


<p align="center">1. Tap the '+' sign on the app's main screen:
<br/>

</p>


<p align="center">2. Do a proud face and gloriously tap the 'End this Fast' option:
<br/>

</p>

<p align="center"> 3. Almost there! As you already know, every fast begins and ends with a meal. So at this stage, Simple will prompt you to log the meal that you ended your fast with. <br/>

*Tip*: As always, you can manually select the time of that fast-breaking meal. This can come in handy if you forgot to log the end of your fast in good time – remember, you can always do it retroactively at this step.

<p align="center">4. Well done, your fast is officially over! Some celebrations are in order! So once you've completed your fast, Simple will reward you with valuable stats and insights on a job well done!<br/>

<p align="center">5. Finally, you can add some personal comments to your completed fast and share your latest achievement with friends, family and maybe even your bitter rivals.

*Tip*: Don't worry if you accidentally end your fast before you meant to. Remember – every fast end with a meal, and every meal you log in Simple can be edited. To make things right, simply go to your Journal and delete the last meal in it (assuming you didn't actually have it). This will resume your fast as if nothing happened.

## 2. Some Things to Note Here

Before this class is over, we'd like to give you a few extra tips to help you get started:

### 2.1 Fasting for Less than 12 Hours
*Please note: If your current fasting period has lasted less than 12 hours, you will not be able to properly log it as 'finished' in the app. You will, however, be able to cancel it whenever you choose to.*
  
In accordance with Simple's Intermittent Fasting methodology, fasting periods that last less than 12 hours are not considered to be proper fasts. Thus, such periods are not logged as fasts within the app, nor do they attribute to your in-app statistics.

### 2.2 Fasting for More than 36 Hours 
*Please note: If you've been fasting for over 36 hours, the app will ask you to confirm that this was indeed intentional. This is done to avoid situations where you accidentally forget to log the end of your fast in good time and wouldn't like inaccurate information to affect your overall statistics.*

If you really did fast for more than 36 hours, you can confirm this in the app, and the said fast will be added to your statistics. Otherwise, Simple will mark the fast as inaccurate and will not add it to your overall stats.

### 2.3 Meals Will Interrupt Fasts
If during an active fasting period, you log a meal for a time AFTER the fast started, this will automatically end your current fast. The newly added food or drink will also be logged as a fast-breaking meal.
